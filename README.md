# Learning Work Tools

This guide is designed to give a short and practical introduction 
to modern work tools in the environment of software programming.

## Using a Version Control System

### Overview

As a version control system we use GIT.

#### Basic Concepts

The following features should be clear to work with GIT locally in the first place:

* Creating a Repository
* Adding Files to a Repository
* Commiting Changes to a Repository

In our first repository we will work directly on the master branch with no 
additional branches. Since we are working locally no commits have to be pushed to a remote repository.

A short introduction into GIT can be found here: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html.

> Try also to understand the workflow behind GIT regarding the "Working Directrory/Staging Area/HEAD" mentioned in the article above.

#### Advances Concepts

* Branches
* Merging
* Tags  

and much more...

### Questions

1. How do you create a local repository with GIT?
2. Which is the name of the default branch you are working on?
3. How do you add files to a repository?
4. How do you add and commit files with a specific commit message?


### Practice

1. Install GIT if not already installed.
2. Use the command line GIT interface.
3. Create a repository as .../practice_git/
4. Practice with the features mentioned above.


## Using a Programming Language

### Overview

As a programming language we choose the Python, since it has a powerful standard library and is relatively easy to use due to its more abstract concepts compared to e.g. C/C++.
