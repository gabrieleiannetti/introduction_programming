# GIT

## Overview

As a version control system we use GIT.

The following features should be clear to work with GIT in the first place:

* Creating a local repository
* Checking the status of the repository
* Adding files to the staging area
* Commiting changes to a repository
* Viewing the repository history
* Showing log messages to a specific commit

In our first repository we will work directly on the master branch with no additional branches.  
Since we are working locally no commits have to be pushed to a remote repository.
