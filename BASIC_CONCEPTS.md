# Basic Concepts

In this section the version control system GIT and programming language Python is introduced.
The goal here is to get a good understanding of the basics in a relatively short time.

## Using a Version Control System

### Overview

As a version control system we use GIT.

The following features should be clear to work with GIT locally in the first place:

* Creating a Repository
* Adding Files to a Repository
* Commiting Changes to a Repository
* Viewing the Repository History

In our first repository we will work directly on the master branch with no 
additional branches. Since we are working locally no commits have to be pushed to a remote repository.

A short introduction into GIT can be found here: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html.

> Try also to understand the workflow behind GIT regarding the "Working Directrory/Staging Area/HEAD" mentioned in the article above.

### Questions

1. How do you create a local repository with GIT?
2. Which is the name of the default branch you are working on?
3. How do you add files to a repository?
4. How do you add and commit files with a specific commit message?
5. How do you view the repository history?

### Practice

1. Install GIT if not already installed.
2. Use the command line GIT interface.
3. Create a repository as .../practice_git/
4. Practice with the features mentioned above.

## Using a Programming Language

### Overview

As a programming language we choose the Python, since it has a powerful standard library and is relatively easy to use due to its more abstract concepts compared to e.g. C/C++.

#### The Python Tutorial

The official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html) is a good starting point to get in touch with the basic concepts:

1. Data Types ([Chapter 3](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html))
2. Control Flows ([Chapter 4](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html))
3. Data Structures ([Chapter 5](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html))

> It is also worth reading the introduction and the first two chapters of the tutorial!  

#### Learn Python the Hard Way

Get a copy of the book __Learn Python the Hard Way__. This book follows a non conventional approach which goes directly to the practical part and let you write some code first and think after. This book seems to fit well in the context of this guide to get you directly in touch with the practical part of programming.
