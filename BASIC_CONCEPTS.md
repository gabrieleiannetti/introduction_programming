# Basic Concepts

In this section the version control system GIT and programming language Python is introduced.
The goal here is to get a good understanding of the basics in a relatively short time.

## Using a Version Control System

### Overview

As a version control system we use GIT.

The following features should be clear to work with GIT in the first place:

* Creating a local repository
* Checking the status of the repository
* Adding files to the staging area
* Commiting changes to a repository
* Viewing the repository history
* Showing log messages to a specific commit

In our first repository we will work directly on the master branch with no 
additional branches. Since we are working locally no commits have to be pushed to a remote repository.

As a reference the following links are suggested:

### Questions

1. How do you create a local repository with GIT?
1. Which is the name of the default branch you are working on?
1. How do you check the status of the repository?
1. How do you add files to the staging area?
1. How do you commit files with a specific commit message?
1. How do you view the repository history?
1. What is the meaning of the working directory, staging area and head?

### Practice

1. Install GIT if not already installed.
2. Use the command line GIT interface.
3. Create a repository as .../practice_git/
4. Answer the questions above.

## Using a Programming Language

### Overview

As a programming language we choose the Python, since it has a powerful standard library and is relatively easy to use due to its more abstract concepts compared to e.g. C/C++.

### Introduction into Python

#### The Python Tutorial

The official Python documentaion provides a great source of knowledge and is a good starting point for learning Python.

To provide a first and basic impression of Python the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is refered to introduce the following aspects in a very short amount of time:

1. Data Types (Chapter 3)
2. Control Flows (Chapter 4 - 4.5)
3. Data Structures (Chapter 5)

> It is also worth reading the introduction and the first two chapters of the tutorial!  

#### Learn Python the Hard Way

To dive directly into the practical part of programming with Python the book __Learn Python the Hard Way__ is used. This book follows a non conventional approach which goes directly to the practical part and let you write some code first and think after.  

This book is taken into account for teaching Python programming when the time window is not to tiny.

The exercises in the book will be grouped into modules where each module represents a check point for reviewing the content learned:

* Module 1 (Exercise 1 - 10)
* Module 2 (Exercise 11 - 14)
* Module 3 (Exercise 15 - 17)
* Module 4 (Exercise 18 - 20)
* Module 5 (exercise 21 - 25)
* Module 6 (exercise 26 - 31)
* Module 7 (exercise 32 - 34)
* Module 8 (exercise 36)
