# Basic Concepts

In this section the version control system GIT and programming language Python is introduced.
The goal here is to get a good understanding of the basics in a relatively short time.

## Using a Version Control System

### Overview

As a version control system we use GIT.

The following features should be clear to work with GIT in the first place:

* Creating a local repository
* Checking the status of the repository
* Adding files to the staging area
* Commiting changes to a repository
* Viewing the repository history
* Showing log messages to a specific commit

In our first repository we will work directly on the master branch with no 
additional branches. Since we are working locally no commits have to be pushed to a remote repository.

As a reference the following links are suggested:

### Questions

1. How do you create a local repository with GIT?
1. Which is the name of the default branch you are working on?
1. How do you check the status of the repository?
1. How do you add files to the staging area?
1. How do you commit files with a specific commit message?
1. How do you view the repository history?
1. What is the meaning of the working directory, staging area and head?

### Practice

1. Install GIT if not already installed.
2. Use the command line GIT interface.
3. Create a repository as .../practice_git/
4. Answer the questions above.

## Using a Programming Language

### Overview

As a programming language we choose the Python, since it has a powerful standard library and is relatively easy to use due to its more abstract concepts compared to e.g. C/C++.

> _Learn about the differences between Python and C++ e.g. https://www.educba.com/python-vs-c-plus-plus/._

#### The Python Tutorial

The official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is a good starting point to get in touch with the following basic concepts:

1. Data Types (Chapter 3)
2. Control Flows (Chapter 4 - 4.5)
3. Data Structures (Chapter 5)

> It is also worth reading the introduction and the first two chapters of the tutorial!  

#### Learn Python the Hard Way

To dive directly into the practical part of programming the book __Learn Python the Hard Way__ is used. This book follows a non conventional approach which goes directly to the practical part and let you write some code first and think after.  

The exercises in the book will be grouped into modules where each module is a mile stone for a review of the content learned from the book:

* Module 1 (Exercise 1 - 10)
* Module 2 (Exercise 11 - 14)
* Module 3 (Exercise 15 - 17)
* Module 4 (Exercise 18 - 20)
