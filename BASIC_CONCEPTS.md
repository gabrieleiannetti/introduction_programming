# Basic Concepts

In this section the version control system GIT and programming language Python is introduced.
The goal here is to get a good understanding of the very basics in a relatively short time.

## Using a Version Control System

### Overview

As a version control system we use GIT.

The following features should be clear to work with GIT locally in the first place:

* Creating a Repository
* Adding Files to a Repository
* Commiting Changes to a Repository
* Viewing the Repository History

In our first repository we will work directly on the master branch with no 
additional branches. Since we are working locally no commits have to be pushed to a remote repository.

A short introduction into GIT can be found here: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html.

> Try also to understand the workflow behind GIT regarding the "Working Directrory/Staging Area/HEAD" mentioned in the article above.

### Questions

1. How do you create a local repository with GIT?
2. Which is the name of the default branch you are working on?
3. How do you add files to a repository?
4. How do you add and commit files with a specific commit message?
5. How do you view the repository history?

### Practice

1. Install GIT if not already installed.
2. Use the command line GIT interface.
3. Create a repository as .../practice_git/
4. Practice with the features mentioned above.

## Using a Programming Language

### Overview

As a programming language we choose the Python, since it has a powerful standard library and is relatively easy to use due to its more abstract concepts compared to e.g. C/C++.

#### The Python Tutorial

The official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is a good starting point to get in touch with the following basic concepts:

1. Data Types (Chapter 3)
2. Control Flows (Chapter 4)
3. Data Structures (Chapter 5)

> It is also worth reading the introduction and the first two chapters of the tutorial!  

#### Learn Python the Hard Way

To dive directly into the practical part of programming the book __Learn Python the Hard Way__ is used. This book follows a non conventional approach which goes directly to the practical part and let you write some code first and think after.  

The exercises in the book will be grouped into modules where each module is a mile stone for a review of the content learned from the book:

* Exercise 1 - 10 (Module 1)
* Exercise 11 - 14 (Module 2)
* Exercise 15 - 17 (Module 3)
* Exercise 18 - 20 (Module 4)
